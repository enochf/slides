## Automated Commencement Slides

The project includes custom code for generating automatic advancing slides for a virtual commencement ceremony. The project is a single page application written in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It loops through a CSV file to include custom images and audio files for each student. Each slide automatically reads the name of the graduate, along with their photo, latin honors, honor societies, and a short user-supplied message.

## Key Controls

Once on the site, simply pressing the right arrow key will initiate the automatic loading of each slide every 8 seconds (or other specified amount). The slides can then be puased and started again using the space bar. Pressing the tilde (~) key will toggle automatic advancement on and off.
